/**
 * A plug-in replacement for JDK1.5 {@link java.util.Hashtable}.  This version
 * is based on {@link org.cliffc.high_scale_lib.NonBlockingHashMap}.  The
 * undocumented iteration order is different from Hashtable, as is the
 * undocumented (lack of) synchronization.  <em>Programs that rely on this
 * undocumented behavior may break</em>.  Otherwise this solution should be
 * completely compatible, including the serialized forms.
 *
 * This version is <strong>not</strong> synchronized, and correctly operates
 * as a thread-safe Hashtable.  It does <strong>not</strong> provide the
 * same ordering guarantees as calling synchronized methods will.  The old
 * Hashtable's methods were synchronized and would provide ordering.  This
 * behavior is not part of Hashtable's spec.  This version's methods are not
 * synchronized and will not force the same Java Memory Model orderings.
 *

 * @since 1.5
